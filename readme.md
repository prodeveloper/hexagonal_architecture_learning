##Hexagonal architecture by fideloper http://fideloper.com/

I loved the talk in that fideloper did on Laracon 2014 and have worked throught the code just to really
soldier it in.

This repo contains the code, most of it is intact, some I have tweaked a bit.

Anyways if you couldn't clearly see or just need the actual files, you are welcome to take from
here.

All appreciation goes back to fideloper.
